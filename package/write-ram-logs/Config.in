    help
      This option enables the write_tmpfs_to_disk service, which
      periodically writes the contents of a tmpfs filesystem to disk.
      This can be useful for systems that store logs or other data in
      a tmpfs to reduce disk I/O, but still want to periodically save
      this data to disk to prevent it from being lost on reboot.
